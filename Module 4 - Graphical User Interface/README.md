#  Module 4 — Graphical User Interface

ctive graphical user interface (GUI) that displays
the fouling growth on the panels. For the most reliable and realistic fouling percentage
to showcase this module, we have chosen to use the manually annotated ground truth
dataset as our input. This will result in the optimal use case for this specific module, and it
will demonstrate the potential of having a uniform medium for representing fouling.

### `main_app.py` — _Graphical Interface for Visualization_  
> _**[Note: Described manually due to length]**_

Serves as the **main application** file for launching the GUI. It integrates all core components from `graph_utils.py`, `table_utils.py`, and `image_utils.py`, allowing users to interactively view image predictions, compare panels.

---

### `Boxplot.py` — _SUS Score Visualization_

Generates a **boxplot** to analyze the distribution of System Usability Scale (SUS) scores gathered from usability testing.

**Features:**
- Visualizes the spread and central tendency of 20 SUS scores
- Uses `seaborn` for clean styling and thicker line widths for clarity
- Titles, labels, and grid lines enhance interpretability

---


### `CalculateFoulingPercentageInsidePanel.py` — _Fouling Area Calculation_

Calculates the **percentage of fouling** within labeled `panel` regions using annotations provided in LabelMe `.json` files.

**Features:**
- Loads images and corresponding JSON annotations
- Creates binary masks for regions labeled as:
  - `panel`: Target area for fouling detection
  - `fouling`: Fouled regions
  - `none`: Valid but clean areas
- Computes:
  - Union of panel + none → defines the "valid analysis area"
  - Intersection of fouling within the valid area
- Calculates the **fouling percentage** as:
**fouling_percentage = (fouling_pixels / (fouling_pixels + clean_pixels)) × 100**
- Results are saved to a JSON file (`fouling_percentages_inside_panel.json`) for GUI and analysis use

### `Cumulative Average Plot.py` — _User Testing Trend Visualization_

Visualizes how the **average System Usability Scale (SUS)** score evolves across participants to assess convergence or variability during testing.

**Features:**
- Plots the **cumulative average SUS score** for each of the 20 test participants
- Helps visualize:
  - Whether usability scores are stabilizing
  - If later participants significantly affect the trend

**Plot Details:**
- **X-axis:** Participant number (1 to 20)
- **Y-axis:** Running average of SUS scores up to that participant
- Includes:
  - Gridlines
  - Individual ticks for each participant
  - Dynamic y-axis range based on min/max scores

### `data.py` — _Load and Structure Fouling Panel Data_

Combines panel organization data and fouling percentages into a unified nested dictionary, structured by **location → month → panel**.

**Features:**
- Defines all panel identifiers per location and month (e.g., `AA1`, `KA3`, etc.)
- Loads fouling percentages from a JSON file (`fouling_percentages_inside_panel_real.json`)
- Handles flexible matching of filenames (e.g., `aa1_month1`, `AA1Month1`)
- Constructs a structured dictionary:

---

### `fouling_percentages_inside_panel_real.json` — _Fouling Metrics Storage_

A JSON file generated by `CalculateFoulingPercentageInsidePanel.py` that stores the **calculated fouling percentages** per panel. This acts as a persistent dataset for GUI interaction and plotting.

---

### `graph_utils.py` — _Graph Rendering for Fouling Timeline_

Provides interactive **timeline plots** for fouling percentages across months using Matplotlib embedded in a Tkinter interface.

**Features**
- Uses color and shape to distinguish between primary and comparison panels.
- Allows user to click on points in the timeline to select/change months.
- Returns Matplotlib objects and mappings to support external callbacks.

---

### `image_utils.py` — _Panel Image Retrieval & Display Utilities_

**Features** 
- Dynamically finds and loads panel images from a structured folder hierarchy.
- Automatically rotates images to ensure upright (portrait) orientation.
- Scales images to fit screen height while preserving aspect ratio.
- Displays images inside Tkinter widgets with reference tracking to prevent garbage collection.

---

### `table_utils.py` — _Fouling Data Table Display & Comparison_

Generates formatted result tables (e.g., image-by-image summary of fouling percentages) for display in the GUI.

**Features**
- Displays fouling percentage per month for a given panel.
- Highlights selected month and supports double-click interaction to trigger image or graph updates
- Offers a side-by-side panel comparison view, even if data is missing for one panel

### `Results.R` — _ System Usability Score (SUS) Statistical Analysis_

Performs a series of statistical analyses on SUS scores from 20 participants to evaluate usability trends, identify outliers, and test significance against a usability benchmark.
